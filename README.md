[Graphi.ts](https://github.com/MoreSaltMoreLemon/graphi.ts) is the collaboration of [Ethan Roberts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eroberts-me/) and [Ezra Schwepker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezra-schwepker/).

We initially wanted to just play around with making an SVG graph to go along with a weather api project we had worked on, however the graph quickly evolved into its own project as we dove down the rabbit hole of making our own HTML canvas graphing tool.

While there's a lot more that can be done with it, we had a great time making the accompanying documentation website and hope you get a kick out of it too.
